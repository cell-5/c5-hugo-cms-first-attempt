      We are currently [7 people](/people), in a distributed remote team, supported by an extensive freelance network.
      
      
      We have experience delivering start-up products from scratch, and supporting them through launches, pivots and scale-ups. 
      
      
      We blend teams with our clients, providing anywhere between one developer or an entire start-up technology team, including acting CTO.

      [Our clients](/clients) are small businesses with between 1-50 people. They are either bootstrapping, early-stage start-ups or trying to make strategic IT investment on a limited budget.
      

      They want to get to market rapidly and iteratively and are looking for an experienced, affordable start-up technology partner who can build or extend their product quickly and sustainably.

      We take [our values](/values) seriously. We can tell you stories about how our actions reflect our values, and what influenced us to form them. They are most useful to help remind us when we go off track, and to help filter [the people](/people) and [the clients](/clients) we choose to work with.

      Building the right team is way more important than [the process](/process), so we try to keep this light.
      

      We also document our currently preferred [tools and techniques](/tools) which we update regularly to reflect our actual working practises.

      Being a remote-first, small I.T. consultancy means we have tried a lot of [tools](/tools) and are always trying to improve our [techniques](/tools).
