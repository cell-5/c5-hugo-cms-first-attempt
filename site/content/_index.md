intro:
  heading: 'Invitations[2]: Start-up clients wanted'
  text: >-
    We are currently looking for one or two new clients to deliver successful
    start-up technology products with. In our experience start-up delivery teams
    are more successful when they:


    * Have a strategy laser focused on solving customer problems

    * Release early and often

    * Take a data driven approach to feature selection

    * Include business and technology experts

    * Share single shared communication channels

    * Foster empathy and respect

    * Follow a light-weight process with a regular frequency ( 1 or 2 week
    cycles )

    * Regularly re-evaluate assumptions

      **Do you agree? If so, we would love the opportunity to be open to collaboration with you, and together we can create a team with the right blend to suit your start-up application product goals.**

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
