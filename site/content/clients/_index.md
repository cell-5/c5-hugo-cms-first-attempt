      [Aphex](https://www.aphex.co/) deliver construction success through innovative planning software. We gained their trust by helping them setup [BuildKite](http://buildkite.com/) on [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) to streamline deployments. We continue to work with them today on app development. Pat from Cell 5 along wtih Aphex's CTO [Elliot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-williams-2a582437/) are delivering features to hit important new milestones on their modern stack of [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/), [MeteorJs](https://www.meteor.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)

      [Tendrr](https://tendrr.co/) are passionate about sailing and saw an opportunity to connect boat owners with sailors and get them out on the water. They were unsatisfied with some aspects of their prototype delivery and had big plans for the product. We recognised their plans lacked a bit of detail, and they were releasing too infrequently. We set about automating deployment with [Github Actions](https://github.com/actions) and responding to and defending against some bot attacks on their system. In parallel, we introduced them to a more iterative approach to development with frequent releases using tools like [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Trello](https://trello.com/). They got particular value from starting to do more collaborative rapid-prototyping in [Figma](https://www.figma.com). We are continuing to build features out for them in PHP on [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/).

      [Carmella Terrana Agency](http://www.ctagencyltd.co.uk/) is a UK wide Event Staffing Agency who reached out to us after a referral. Carmella wanted us to completely revamp their website and build a staff management, registration and search application that they can use to manage their staff and prepare for events. They wanted to engage with us in a very low-touch way, given how busy they are, focusing on their clients. We were flexible, pausing the project at various times, as needed. When the time was right, we built out a prototype in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), and picked up the engagement, and are currently working on their website rebranding.

      [good2rent](https://www.good2rent.co.uk/) are automating tenant referencing and pioneered rental passporting. They had an unlaunched prototype when we joined which we launched, supported and helped them grow. We then embarked on a larger pivot, to include a better user experience on [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) stack with more automation. We did analysis on and integrated [Open Banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_banking). While partnering with them we consolidated their infrastructure to be [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) defined, and containerized all their [golang](https://golang.org/), java and python services on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).
