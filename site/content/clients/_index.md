      Tendrr are passionate about sailing and saw an opportunity to connect boat owners and sailors, to get more people out on the water. They were unsatisfied with some aspects of their prototype delivery and had big plans for the product. We realised their vision lacked some detail, and introduced them to a more iterative approach to development. We introduced them to Figma, for collaborative, rapid prototyping. We helped them harden some aspects of their site to protect it from bots, and are building features with them daily. Here is Harry and Sam talking about their experience with Figma.
