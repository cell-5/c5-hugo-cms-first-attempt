      "When I joined Cell 5 I wanted to grow by doing more and get variety and that is what I got. I do quality work for multiple start-up companies. Having flexibility in my work schedule helps me manage my personal time easier - having this kind of power made me even more productive because I can work at times I know I am at my fullest. I appreciate the aspiration to have a culture of knowledge sharing and empathy. In Cell 5 we are a team of humans - making mistakes is an opportunity to learn more - no bullying and shaming here, there is no such thing as a stupid question - I gained confidence from this and can't wait for the next project!"
