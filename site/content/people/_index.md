      "I started Cell 5 because I wanted to keep my team together after a project finished. We always found the process of hiring our most challenging, and we were hearing the same from clients. Attractive pricing was driving small business owners and start-up founders to look online and overseas, but they weren't getting results. They didn't have the time for D.I.Y platforms and were building things twice when hiring through gig platforms. So that is the space we chose to occupy. We keep it simple, we hire quality people, and try our best to keep them in the same team. We educate clients on how to get the best out of them, keeping costs low by being remote-first."
