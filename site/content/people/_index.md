      "I started Cell 5 because I wanted to keep my team together after a project finished. We always found the process of hiring our most challenging, and we were hearing the same from clients. Attractive pricing was driving small business owners and start-up founders to look remote and overseas, but they weren't getting results. They didn't have the time for D.I.Y platforms and were building things twice when hiring through gig platforms. So that is the space we chose to occupy. We keep it simple, we hire quality people, and try our best to keep them in the same team. We educate clients on how to get the best out of them, keeping costs low by being remote-first."

      When I joined Cell 5 I wanted to grow by doing more and get variety and that is what I got. I do quality work for multiple start-up companies. Having flexibility in my work schedule helps me manage my personal time easier - having this kind of power made me even more productive because I can work at times I know I am at my fullest. I appreciate the aspiration to have a culture of knowledge sharing and empathy. In Cell 5 we are a team of humans - making mistakes is an opportunity to learn more - no bullying and shaming here, there is no such thing as a stupid question - I gained confidence from this and can't wait for the next project!

      We have an extended team of trusted partners that we have worked with before. Designers, mobile app developers, social media managers, content writers, S.E.O specialists, photographers, data scientists etc. If the skill relates to digital or start-ups, we probably know someone who we have collaborated with before to recommend.
