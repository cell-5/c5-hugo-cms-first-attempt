>> OnlineJobs.ph is the only platform that we know of that offers direct access to great remote developer candidates, takes no fees from either party, with unlimited job postings for a fixed monthly fee.

 But it is not suitable for recruiters or direct business hires. It requires you to be able to conduct full in depth technical interviews.

### Our Challenge

We are a bootstrapped small consultancy, with low prices delivering to high value disruptive start-ups. We cannot afford large recruitment advertising budgets nor can we afford to bring people onboard for any long period of time without work for them to do. 

We have some ethical goals. To offer people long term stability, challenging relevant marketable work, personal growth, independence and trust, which despite our size we do try to take seriously. 

### Finding People

We have tried hiring from online sites like Upwork, Bark, PeoplePerHour, ... and usually the fees the system takes and the short term nature of the relationships does not suit our values and delivery needs. In our experience, picking the right person and growing with them, and having them learn our ways and vice versa creates much better long term value and client results. 

Fortunately for us, OnlineJobs.ph, offers a very attractive recruitment model for us. For a small flat fee you can directly contact remote workers in Philippines, and you get great value candidates. It took us over 18 months to tune our workflow to get good results but we are now confident in it. 

I would not recommend someone non-technical hires developers there, as it is less of a polished product with more risk than "gig" sites. We on the other hand are expert techincal recruiters and hands on ourselves, so if this is you, it could also serve your needs well.

We opt-in to the monthly fee during periods of recruitment, and go back to free subscription when not actively recruiting. You can post ads usually get 10s-100s of applicants in a few days, and very rarely find no quality candidates worth taking through the vetting process. 

### Finding the Right People

Once we have a set of candidates we use a free Google Docs plugin which allows bulk email at 50 a time called. ( if needed ) and we email the candidates our process information and ask for any missing details we need. 

Assuming we have got it down to say 5-10 candidates we then offer a paid test ( at half their normal rate). 

This test is designed to be simple enough technically ( e.g. build a shopping cart full stack app) but is deliberately asked for in a technology stack they have never used before. For instance a java/php developer might be asked to code in Golang and React/Vue. 

The process is light forus at first time wise, with the completing the paid trial, but we feel fair as they are not working for nothing. 

We find this quickly weeds out people who are not serious or incapable at present.

Once the demo application is built to our specification they must provide us two gitlab repos ( one front and one backend) with PRs listing their changes to each, and with a screen cast showing and explaining their changes. 

Finally if we feel they met the brief, have sufficient code quality, and good comms we then proceed to a final video conference call where we dig a bit more into their code, and their work experience. We can agree terms and start dates within days.

### Finding the Right People at the Right Price

The rates we pay developers varies, but it is definitely a low rate compared to global averages for developers. But we make a deliberate effort to keep fixed costs down. Our model then is to pay a basic salary which gives security, and paid holidays, but to provide other bonus incentives based on client delivery work, and we distribute excess profit at the end of the year based on our performance.

This allows us to navigate stormy seas while small, and might change if we reach sufficent scale, though we only want to grow very gradually to keep a handle on the quality and culture of the company. 

We try not have heros or a internal competitiveness, we are very outward looking, toward new opportunites and growth and we think this more than offsets and divisiveness individual bonuses present. In our experience it is important to hold people accoutable and reward them for their own work, but equally important to reward the team too as a whole, and we have provision for both. 

### Training and Onboarding

Honestly we are so small training is pretty much non existence at present other than on the job. We have never deployed someone in the first 2 or 3 weeks to a client project, but its not impossible at all if they are ready. But usually they come onboard and help us with internal projects / website work, and then start to informally shadow someone on the client side, maybe picking up tickets for a week or two before charging. Once we are all happy the team is a fit and things are going smoothly we start to bill the client for the team member.  

### Remote Workers Flexibility

Some outsourcing companies or large agencines and even some online platforms, monitor and control their remote workers with things like screen recording software. This is the antithesis of why people, in philippines or anywhere choose remote work. Which is usually because of the flexibility. We respect their privacy, and we do not check what hours they work. We hire people and incentivize people who are passionate about delivery and their craft and have a strong work ethic. If they do not they will not last long in our free form organization. In our modern society anyone who has the entrepenurial spirit to run a side hustle should be celebrated and is. We would love for budding enterpeneurs in our organization share ideas with us for us to help support and fund them as a joint venture. Provided of course it is does not noticeablely impact their delivery commitments with us and our client.

### Teams

We have experience of projects that have gone less smoothly so we carefully assess the mix of the people and espeically early on how the relationships and comms are going. Usually if the business provide a Product Owner / strong BA and are willing to prioritize and even potentially help spec out features and wireframes then things tend to be perfect. If that is missing we provide it, but then great care is needed to make sure that the product is on point. We have suffered when we have to be the product brains for the client too much and then build something not in their vision ( whether or not our approach would be better in market. )
