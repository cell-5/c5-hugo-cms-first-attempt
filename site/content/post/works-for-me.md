>> I have been trying to approach strategy by giving things a go. If they worked we did more of them, and if they didn't, we did less. 

### Easy right?

Well that might be useful for increments of something, like a product delivery, but it does not stop you heading in the wrong direction altogether.

I can and have, worked my people into the ground for a milestone, to get a client delivery out, but it just doesn't build a motivated, resiliant, delivery team, so it's not **long term value**.

### Misteaks were made

I am **proud of our retention rates** in Cell 5. The first people we hired, still work with us today ( @Pat and @Jedi - I hope this is true for many years to come). 
However, that initial retention still conceals quite a few false-starts. People that did not last long as we were figuring out what roles we had and where people fitted in and we fucked up - moving too fast.

>> I don't beat myself up about mistakes, **if you don't fail, you dont learn**, but I do not want to repeat the same ones again and again. 

### Looking back to move forward

The process here is one of archiving things that worked and didnt, so we can draw on it to help us set our direction for 2020 and beyond.
