process:
  - heading: "1. Establish Fit & Agree Mission"
    text: >
      Within the first conversation with a client we establish if there is a fit. We get three questions answered.
      + Are we trying to build a product that delivers lasting value?
      + Can we realistically deliver what is needed?
      3. Are we ready to execute?

  - heading: "2. Blend a Team"
    text: >
      The roles usually needed on the team are: Product Architecture, Project Management, Product Ownership, User Experience, Design, Development, DevOps and Quality Assurance. The same person is likely to deliver more than one role, and they can come from either organization. We also identify other specialists that might be needed in bursts through the project such as Data scientists, A.I. specialists, Machine Learning specialists, OpenBanking, Security, Design, Digital Marketing, Mobile App Developers, etc. We have experience providing various size teams from one junior developer to an entire start-up team from CTO down. The recipe for success always starts with the right team.

  - heading: "3. Execute"
    text: >
      We put a lot of effort into picking the right people, and are not dogmatic on process. However, there are various traits to our execution which we believe are important. 
      - Rythm (at least fortnightly planning meeting but not more than weekly)
      - Frequent Releases ( at least fortnightly releases but as much as daily)
      - Data driven feature selection
      - Code Review Process ( 4-eyes rule)
      - Automate repetitive tasks

  - heading: "4. Amplify"
    text: >
      Delivery is not done when the product is launched. It is done when value is created and maximized. This can be measured in sales, sign-ups, lessons learnt from failures or brand-awareness. We also take care before considering an engagment complete that we have amplified it to its full potential.
