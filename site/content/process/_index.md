    Building the right team is way more important than the process, so we try to keep this light. We also document our currently preferred [tools and techniques](/tools) which we update regularly to reflect our actual working practises.

process:
  - heading: "1. Establish Fit & Agree Mission"
    text: >
      Within the first conversation with a client we establish if there is a fit. Our goal is to answer three questions.


      1> Are we trying to build a product that delivers lasting value?
      
      
      2> Can we realistically deliver what is needed?
      
      
      3> Are we ready to execute?

  - heading: "2. Blend a Team"
    text: >          
      The recipe for success always starts with the right team.


      The roles a team need vary based on the project, and on what skills our client brings to the table. 


      [Our people](/people) are mostly skilled adaptable generalists, each having their own specialities and strengths. We can deliver a good job across most aspects of the project.  
      

      That said, it is important to make sure we have the right mix of business skills, technical skills and specialist skills to succeed. If we need to call in specialist expertise to deliver we will let you know.

  - heading: "3. Execute"
    text: >
      We put a lot of effort into picking the right people, and are not dogmatic on process. However, there are various traits to our execution which we believe are important.
      

      In a nutshell we will aim to deliver early and often, to have regular change review, prioritization and planning meetings, to focus on finshing things and limiting work in progress. 
      
      
      Probably most importantly, to be listening and open to change when our team say things are not working.

  - heading: "4. Amplify"
    text: >
      Delivery is not done when the product is launched. It is done when value is created and maximized. 
      
      
      This can be measured in sales, sign-ups, lessons learnt from failures or brand-awareness. 
      
      
      We take care for each task to understand what needs to be realised to maximize its success. 
      
      
      We do not consider a task or engagement complete, until we have amplified the value to its full potential.
