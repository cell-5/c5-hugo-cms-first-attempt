  - heading: "Take action, over deliberation"
    text: >
      In our experience execution informs strategy the best. Indecision and standing still is not a strategy. We advise clients to get something live and iterate. As we build products we maximize the speed of release.

  - heading: "Focus on long term value"
    text: >
      Decision on our hiring, client selection and marketing are all taken to maximize long term value. When we market, we look to enhance our brand and reputation rather than focus on lead genration.

  - heading: "Champion remote-first teams"
    text: >  
      We benefit from partnering with clients in higher cost locations, and supply teams in lower cost locations for delivery. We are proud that we can offer our remote employees flexible, long term, interesting work solving real problems and offering them opportunities, while our clients get access to a competitive remote team.

      We redistribute 15% of profit as bonuses to our Philippines team. We are open to our team having a product idea, and backing that idea with funds and leadership opportunities. We offer fee discounts in exchange for equity in client businesses, showing we encourage small business and believe in those we partner with.

  - heading: "Have empathy"
    text: >
      The software industry is awash with egos and arrogance and one-up-man-ship which we think gets in the way of team performance. 
    
      
      We recognise individual contributions, but we always put the team ahead of the individual.
