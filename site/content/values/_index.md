      As a small company, we cannot afford to waste resources, so planning is important. However, we think the experience of doing usually informs strategy the best. We advise clients similarly, perfect is the enemy of good, get something live and iterate. 

      When we hire, we look for people with adaptive intelligence who can deliver. When we build products we use processes to maximize release cadence and flow.

  - heading: "Focus on long term value"
    text: >
      We are small, and want to scale but not at the expense of our values or the health of our brand. We are selective about which clients we partner with. We only work with clients that can convince us they are creating long-term value in the world, that is net-positive. This also drives our approach to delivery and our marketing. We prefer long term parnterhips and sharing value to build brand awareness, over selling.

  - heading: "Champion remote-first teams"
    text: >  
      We benefit from the ability to find partners in high cost locations, and build teams in lower cost locations for delivery and it can be a point of moral contention.
      However, we are proud that we can offer our remote employees flexible long term remote work on interesting projects. We champion and encourage them to deliver, innovate and lead.

  - heading: "Encourage small business & profit Sharing"
    text: >
      We encourage our employees to be entrepenurial, and contribute ideas to forward our business. We offer some capital and support for ideas, a leadership position and equity for them to run with the idea. We re-distribute 15% of profits to our remote employees in bonuses.
      
      For clients, we can replace our fees for equity to help them get to market with their ideas for greatly reduced tech cost.

  - heading: "Fail fast, but differently"
    text: >
      In parts of society, 8th place is celebrated. We think this is wrong, failure hurts us. That said blame, is worse than useless. We record our failures and share them. The record of them and the dialog around them, helps us to avoid repeating them.

  - heading: "Have Empathy"
    text: >
      The software industry is awash with egos and arrogance and one-up-man-ship which we think gets in the way of team performance. We recognise individual contributions, but we actively defend our culture through hiring and reminding each other to be compassionate, forviging and respectful. We demand the same from our clients.
